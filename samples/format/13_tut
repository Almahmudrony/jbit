	; ".bits" is an alternative method to type binary numbers
	; with 0s filled on the right. This:
	.bits "0101"

	; Is the same as this:
	%01010000

	; You are not limited to 8 bits
	.bits "010101010101"

	; You can change the characters used with ".lookup" (default is "01").
	.lookup " X"
	.bits " X X X X X X"

	; You can map 2, 4 or 16 character (but you don't need to declare
	; all of them if you don't use them).
	; Here every character is mapped to 2 bits:
	.lookup " .X"
	.bits " XX "
	.bits "X..X"
	.bits "X..X"
	.bits "XXXX"

	; Dumplicate characters are allowed, but only the first match
	; is considered.
	; Here every character is mapped to 4 bits:
	.lookup ".X..."
	.bits ".X.X"
