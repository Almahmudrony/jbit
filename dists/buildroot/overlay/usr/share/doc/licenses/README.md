Licenses
========

Not every license is included here.
If you really want to look at every
single license, you are advised to
rebuild the image using buildroot
and examine all the archive files
that are downloaded.

A significant selection is included,
though. For example:

* GPL2 is used by the linux kernel
  and by the busybox toolset.
* LGPL21 is used by the
  arm C library (uClibc).
* BSD-like licenses are used by the
  firmware (rpi) and by the
  6502 emulator (jbit).
* A custom license is used by the
  6502 C compiler (cc65).
