                                    JBit

                     A 6502 Framework for Mobile Phones

   The source of the JBit MIDlet is released under the GNU LGPL 2.1
   (see the included COPYING.LIB).

   To compile JBit from source you will need:
      * Java SE Development Kit. I use version 1.6.0; any version
        should be fine.
      * Sun Java Wireless Toolkit. I use versions 1.0.4 and 2.5;
        again, any version should be fine.
      * Ant. I use versions 1.6.5 and 1.7.0; I have no idea if you
        can use other versions.
      * Antenna. I use version 1.2.1beta; older versions should work.
      * ProGuard. I use version 4.4; older versions should work.

   If your environment is setup correctly, you should be able to
   compile JBit by editing build.xml and running ant.
