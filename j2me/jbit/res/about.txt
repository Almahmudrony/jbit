Monitor Keys: 2, 4, 6 and 8 are the cursor keys. 1 performs 1 step. 3 performs n steps (you can select n by using the option StepSize; default is 10). 7 goes to the next line. 9 steps out of the current subroutine. 0 switches between CPU and MEM view. * continues the program (you can then pause it by pressing a soft key). # shows the video (you can then go back to the monitor by pressing any key). In MEM view, 5 changes the value of a cell. Select Edit to change the registers of the CPU.
Editor NAV Mode Keys: 2, 4, 6 and 8 are the cursor keys. 5 switches to EDT mode. 1 goes to the previous snap point, 3 to the next one. 7 sets the mark and 0 swaps the cursor and the mark. 9 goes to the address of the operand. * runs the program. # switches between ASM and MEM minor modes. 
Editor EDT Mode Keys: * moves to the next cell. # switches between ASM and MEM minor modes. In MEM minor mode, 0-9 are used to enter the decimal value of the cell. In ASM minor mode, 2-9 are used to enter the letters of the mnemonic.
Editor Example: To enter LDA #12 press 5 to enter EDT mode, then press # to enter ASM minor mode, then press the sequence 5 JKL, 3 DEF and 2 ABC for L-D-A, then select the instruction LDA #n from the list, then press 1 and 2 to enter the operand and finally select OK to confirm the instruction.
On some phones, use @ for #.
