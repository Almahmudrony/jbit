JBit
====

This is a JavaScript version of the JBit Virtual Machine (with MicroIO)
hosted on the V8 JavaScript Engine.

JBit is a 6502 simulator and development environment. It targets feature
phones, but a web version is in progress. You can see a (quite old) web
host for this code here:

http://jbit.sourceforge.net/webapp


Compile
-------

Beside the usual gcc/g++ toolchain, you need the development versions of
ncurses and libv8. On a debian, this means having the following packages
installed:

libncurses5-dev
libv8-dev

Tested on debian stable.


Run
---

Type:

./jbit samples/charset.jb

Then press 2 and 8 to scroll and 0 to halt the program.

More samples that work on MicroIO are available here:

http://jbit.sourceforge.net/gallery/list.php?tag=microio

If you move the executable, you have to set the environment variable
JBIT_RES to point to the res directory.

Beside the keys shown on screen, there are also a couple of support
keys.

Pressing 'S' (uppercase) writes a screenshot to 'out.ppm'.
If you have SDL, pressing 'D' (uppercase) should bring up a window with
the display output. Note that you do not need to compile with
libsdl1.2-dev for this to work.
